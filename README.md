## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

### Technical Limitations

#### 1. Data Access Constraints
- **Public Content Only**: Can only analyze publicly visible posts and comments
- **API Rate Limits**: Reddit's API has built-in rate limiting
- **Content Limits**: Maximum 2000 posts/comments per scraping session
- **No Real-time Data**: Analysis based on historical content only

#### 2. Scraping Limitations
- **Deleted Content**: Cannot access deleted or removed posts
- **Private Profiles**: Cannot analyze private or suspended accounts
- **Shadowbanned Content**: May miss shadowbanned posts
- **API Changes**: Reddit API changes may affect functionality

#### 3. Analysis Accuracy
- **Inference-Based**: Demographics are inferred, not factual
- **Context Limitations**: May miss sarcasm, irony, or context
- **Keyword Dependency**: Analysis relies on keyword matching
- **Bias Potential**: May reflect algorithmic biases in keyword selection

### Analytical Limitations

#### 1. Demographic Inference
- **Age Groups**: Broad categories, not specific ages
- **Gender**: Binary classification, may miss non-binary identities
- **Location**: Based on mentions, not current residence
- **Accuracy**: No ground truth validation available

#### 2. Interest Detection
- **Surface-Level**: Based on keyword frequency, not depth
- **Context-Agnostic**: May misclassify ironic or quoted content
- **Limited Categories**: Only 8 predefined interest areas
- **Threshold Issues**: May miss interests with low mention frequency

#### 3. Personality Analysis
- **Simplified Model**: Basic trait detection, not comprehensive
- **Language-Dependent**: Works best with English content
- **Temporal Bias**: May reflect recent activity more than historical
- **No Validation**: Not validated against psychological assessments

### Data Quality Issues

#### 1. Sampling Bias
- **Recency Bias**: Recent posts may be overrepresented
- **Subreddit Bias**: Analysis skewed toward active subreddits
- **Volume Bias**: Heavy posters may appear more prominent
- **Temporal Bias**: Analysis reflects posting period, not lifetime

#### 2. Content Quality
- **Spam Detection**: No filtering for spam or bot content
- **Multiple Accounts**: Cannot detect if user has multiple accounts
- **Shared Accounts**: Cannot identify shared account usage
- **Content Authenticity**: No verification of content truthfulness

#### 3. Classification Errors

- **False Negatives**: May miss actual characteristics
- **Ambiguous Content**: Difficulty with ambiguous or unclear posts
- **Contextual Misunderstanding**: May misinterpret context-dependent content

## üîí Privacy and Ethics

### Privacy Considerations
- **Public Data Only**: Only analyzes publicly available content
- **No Personal Information**: Does not collect email, IP, or private data

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Installation Problems
```bash
# If pip install fails
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For permission issues
pip install --user -r requirements.txt
```

#### 2. Network Errors
- **Solution**: Check internet connection
- **Rate Limiting**: Wait a few minutes if getting 429 errors
- **Firewall**: Ensure Reddit is not blocked by firewall

#### 3. No Content Found
- **Private Profile**: User may have private profile
- **Deleted Account**: Account may be deleted or suspended
- **New Account**: Very new accounts may have minimal content
